## Overview

Welcome to my GitHub repository documenting my journey as an AI Data Analyst intern! This project focuses on analyzing student engagement data using AI techniques to extract valuable insights and support decision-making processes.

## Milestones

### Week 1: Data Preparation

- **Objective:** Prepare a preprocessed dataset that is cleaned, transformed, and ready for analysis.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Data wrangling: cleaning and transforming raw data.
  - Ensuring data quality and consistency for subsequent analysis.


## Project Goals

By the end of the internship, I aim to deliver a comprehensive report and presentation that includes:

- Detailed analysis of student engagement.
- Results from predictive modeling and churn analysis.
- Actionable recommendations for improving engagement.
- A prototype of a recommendation system.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- Data Visualization Tools
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis
